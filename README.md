:exclamation: When updating repo for a new course, change `output_dir: XXXX` in `_site.yml` as the first thing, so that old rendered files are not overwritten.

:exclamation: Do not push any rendered .html files or intermediates.

## Repo organisation

The 3-day course source material is located on the *master* branch (default). The 2-day course material is located on the *twoday* branch. The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *master* or *twoday* branches are automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

:exclamation: The first build can take around 40 mins depending on the number of R packages. Subsequent builds take about 6-7 minutes since caching is enabled. Caches are removed after 7 days of last access. A push after that will require a full rebuild.
